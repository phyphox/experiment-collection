# Summary
This file is the template for all experiments. It contains all information needed for a full description of the expertiments. All experiments should use the structure of this template document. It also contains explanations of the tags and some examples for structuring the experiment.

The experiment should contain the following sections:
1. Summary
2. Materials
3. Setup
4. Measurement
5. Analysis
6. Supplementary material (optional)
7. Examples (optional)
8. Experiment variants (optional)
9. Troubleshooting / problems and resolutions (optional)
10. Literature and sources

The contents shold be written in markdown ad defined by the [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/) standard, where a extensive documentation can be found. Some examples are also given here.

## Tagging
Tags are given in the following categories (given as an array and separated by comma):

**Topic**: Select one or more from *[Mechanics, Waves and Sound and Optics, Electricity and Magnetism, Thermal and Statistical, Astronomy, Quantum]*. The topic tags are inspired by [physport](https://www.physport.org/).

**Sensor**: Select one or more from *[Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Light, Location, Pressure, Temperature, Humidity, Proximity, Speaker]*. External sensors are to listed yet, but need to be implemented.

**Level**: Select one or more from *[0, 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 6, 7]*. This refers to the ISCED-2011 Level. *0* is pre-school (Vorschule in Germany), *1* is primary school (Grundschule), *2* is lower secondary education but we distinguish in the German Orientierungsstufe (*2a*, class level 5 and 6) and Sekundarstufe I (*2b*, class level 7, 8, 9 and 10). *3* is upper secondary education (Oberstufe), *6* is Bachelor level and *7* is Master level. Inspired by the German [Bildungsministerium](https://www.datenportal.bmbf.de/portal/de/G293.html).

**Competencies**: Only for German education, this is a **TODO**.

**Material**: The level of additional material, select **one** from *[Smartphone only, Household items required, Basic experiment material required, Special equipment required]*.

# Material
A short description of the used material.

# Setup
The setup of the experiemt, best visualized with some images. The phyphox code of the experiment belongs here.

How to display images correctly is a **TODO**.

# Measurement
The measurement data.

# Analysis
Further analysis of the data. 

# Supplementary material
Additional material, for example working sheets.

# Examples
Some example measurements with their analysis.

# Experiment variants
If the experiemts has some variants, for example different variables are measured, they go here.

# Troubleshooting / problems and resolutions
If problems can occur, the resolutions are noted here.

# Literature and sources
The source of the experiment and some additional literature if existing.

How to cite is still a **TODO**.
